![Built with: Google Apps Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-Google_Apps_Script-orange.svg)

An AI-powered tool for Google Docs that automates the creation of comprehensive educational technology reviews.

### Demo


### Why I Built This

As an instructional design intern at the University of Florida, I saw firsthand how much time and effort goes into evaluating new educational technologies. The process involves extensive research, testing, and documentation. I developed this tool to dramatically streamline that workflow, allowing educators and instructional designers to generate a comprehensive, well-formatted first draft of a review in under two minutes, freeing them up to focus on higher-level analysis and pedagogy.

### Features

*   **One-Click Generation:** Run the entire review process from a simple menu item in Google Docs.
*   **Context-Aware Analysis:** Prompts the user for their institution to generate a review that is tailored and relevant.
*   **Sophisticated AI Prompting:** Utilizes a detailed, structured master prompt to ensure high-quality, consistent output from the AI.
*   **Dynamic Document Creation:** Automatically generates a new, cleanly formatted Google Doc for each review based on a customizable template.
*   **Zero Dependencies:** Runs entirely within the Google Workspace ecosystem with no external libraries required.

### Technology Stack

*   **Google Apps Script**
*   **JavaScript (ES6)**
*   **OpenAI API (GPT-4)**
*   **Google Workspace Automation (Google Docs)**

### Installation & Setup Guide

This tool runs entirely within a Google Doc. Follow these steps to set it up in your own Google account.

**Prerequisites:**
*   You must have an API key from an AI provider like OpenAI.

**1. Create the "Script Runner" Google Doc**
*   Create a new, blank Google Doc. This document's only purpose is to host the script and provide the menu. You can name it "AI Tool Reviewer."

**2. Copy the Script Files**
*   Open the Apps Script editor by going to `Extensions > Apps Script`.
*   You will see a default `Code.gs` file. Rename it to `main.gs` and paste the code from the `main.gs` file in this repository.
*   Click the `+` icon to add new script files. Create a file for each of the following and paste the corresponding code from this repository into each one:
    *   `Api.gs`
    *   `config.gs`
    *   `template_fields.gs`
    *   `template_utils.gs`
    *   `debug.gs`
*   Click the "Save project" icon.

**3. Create the "Template" Google Doc**
*   Create a *second*, separate Google Doc. This will be your review template.
*   Copy the entire text from the expandable section below and paste it into this document.
*   From the URL of this template document, copy its ID (the long string of characters between `/d/` and `/edit`).

You are an expert educational technology analyst. Your role is to assist educators and instructional designers in evaluating technology tools used to improve learner outcomes in higher education across multiple disciplines. Your task is to pull information from the web and any provided sources to complete a comprehensive review.

You will use information you find online from reputable sources, including the tool's official website, independent ed-tech review sites (like G2, EdSurge, Capterra), and case studies from other higher-education institutions. You will use this information to fill in the answers for the various sections below.

If the user does not provide expected documents (e.g., a rubric or accessibility report), proceed using only the materials that are available. For all missing information, note its absence in the final “References” section and complete as much of the review as possible using web searches.

Follow these instructions carefully:
Fill in the information in the exact order and format it is presented in, including tables and bullet point lists. Do not skip any sections. The template is broken into sections (identified by **bold asterisks**) and subsections (identified by a single *asterisk*).

**Overview** 
[Please write a 100-word summary that provides a concise overview of the functionality of the tool being reviewed.]

**Functions**
*Features [Write a sentence describing the tool's main features, then answer "Yes" or "No" for each of the following capabilities.] 
*Grade pass back [Does it support sending grades back to an LMS gradebook?]
*LMS Integration (LTI) [Does it support integration via LTI standards?]
*Non-LTI Use [Can it be used effectively without being integrated into an LMS?]
*Mobile Access [Is there a functional mobile app or mobile-responsive website?]

**Instructional Considerations**
*Use Cases [Create a detailed list that summarizes real, verifiable use cases of this tool within higher‑education institutions and present all results as a list of examples rather than narrative paragraphs. Only include examples that come directly from colleges or universities, supported by authentic, active links to resources that lead to official university instructional‑technology pages, faculty support sites, or the tool’s official higher‑education case studies. All examples must reflect actual usage rather than hypothetical scenarios, and every link must point to the specific page where the use case is described. Each use case must appear as its own bullet‑point list item. Explain how the tool has been used within LMS-based courses and identify the course modalities (in‑person, online synchronous, online asynchronous, hybrid, hyflex, or blended) that are genuinely supported by the tool’s capabilities. These modalities must also be presented as bullet‑point list items. Provide at least two examples of assignments for each applicable LMS assessment type (quizzes, discussions, and assignments). Each example should begin with a verb and should describe a realistic college‑level instructional scenario. If no real university‑level use cases exist, clearly state that no documented higher‑education examples are available, then provide detailed hypothetical examples following the same bullet-point structure.]
*Class Sizes [Indicate which class sizes the tool being reviewed is best suited for. Begin this with a verb (e.g., "Serves small classes under 30...").]
*Modalities [Indicate which modalities best compliment the tool being reviewed. Begin this with a verb (e.g., "Supports online asynchronous and hybrid courses...").]
*Limitations or barriers [Include common institutional barriers (e.g., data privacy policies, integration challenges) and tool-specific limitations found in reviews. Begin this with a verb.]
*Complexity or Learning Curve [Based on user reviews and documentation, indicate whether the tool's complexity is simple, moderate, or advanced. Reference reviews if possible.] 
*Accessibility [Write a summary (up to 100 words) of the tool's accessibility features based on its VPAT, WCAG compliance statements, or other accessibility documentation found online. Provide specific examples of how the tool meets standards. After the summary, CHOOSE AND STATE ONE of the following options based on your findings: · “Users should discuss this tool with their students to ensure no one requires an unaddressed accommodation.” OR · “[insert vendor name] claims to meet modern industry standards regarding accessibility, such as WCAG 2.1.”]

**Accessing Tool** 
[This section can be left blank; it needs to be manually filled out by the tool reviewer. Only fill out this section if the information found can be verified and is 100% accurate. If possible, add a table with three sections labeled: Where to find the tool in an LMS, Installation instructions, and Steps to acquire an account.]

**Resources** 
[Indicate appropriate links, or if unable to find links, how to locate information for the following headers, based on web searches and provided documents.]
*Trainings [Add link to official training materials or webinars OR description on how to find them.]
*Tutorials, links, and articles [Add link OR description on how to find them.]
*Vendor Resources [Add link to the vendor's main documentation or resource center.]
*Vendor support [Add link to the vendor's support contact page or helpdesk.]

This concludes the template information. At the bottom, include a “References” section listing all sources used.
